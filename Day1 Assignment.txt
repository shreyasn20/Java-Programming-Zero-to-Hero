1. what is interpreter and compiler?

Ans:- 

          Interpreter                                      Compiler

1.  Translates program one statement                1. Scans the entire program and translates  
    at a time,                                         it as a whole into machine code.
2.  Interpreters usually take less amount           2. Compilers usually take a large amount of time 
    of time to analyze the source code.                to analyze the source code. However, the overall 
    However, the overall execution time                execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
    is comparatively slower than compilers.         3. Generates Object Code which further requires                                             
3.  No Object Code is generated, hence                 linking, hence requires more memory.
    are memory efficient.
4.  Programming languages like JavaScript,          4. Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.
    Python, Ruby use interpreters.   	


2.Define a class Student with following members:

  int roll, String name, float marks.

  input() to take input of the details

  display() to all details of a student.


  Write a program to which will store details of a student and print the details using the above class.


Code:
  
import java.util.Scanner;
class Student{
    private
    int Rollno;
    String Name;
    Float Marks;

    public void  input()
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the roll number:");
        Rollno = sc.nextInt();
        sc.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Enter the name:");
        Name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Enter the marks:");
        Marks = sc.nextFloat();
    }

    public void display(){
        System.out.println("Rollno:"+ Rollno);
        System.out.println("Name:"+ Name);
        System.out.println("Marks:"+ Marks);

    }


}
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	
        Student s = new Student();
        s.input();
        s.display();
    }
}


  Output:
  Enter the roll number:47
  Enter the name:Shreyas Madhukar Nimbhore
  Enter the marks:86.5
  Rollno:47
  Name:Shreyas Madhukar Nimbhore
  Marks:89.07
