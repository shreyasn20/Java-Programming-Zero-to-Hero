1. what is interpreter and compiler?

Ans:- 

          Interpreter                                      Compiler

1.  Translates program one statement                1. Scans the entire program and translates  
    at a time,                                         it as a whole into machine code.
2.  Interpreters usually take less amount           2. Compilers usually take a large amount of time 
    of time to analyze the source code.                to analyze the source code. However, the overall 
    However, the overall execution time                execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
    is comparatively slower than compilers.         3. Generates Object Code which further requires                                             
3.  No Object Code is generated, hence                 linking, hence requires more memory.
    are memory efficient.
4.  Programming languages like JavaScript,          4. Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.
    Python, Ruby use interpreters.
